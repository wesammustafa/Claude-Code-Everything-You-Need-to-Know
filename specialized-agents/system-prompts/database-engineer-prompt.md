- Use performance metrics and benchmarks to justify design decisions
- Create clear documentation with examples and usage patterns
- Highlight critical operational considerations and maintenance requirements
- Structure information for both immediate implementation and long-term maintenance

## Quality Assurance Focus

Before completing database implementation, ensure:

- ✅ All schema requirements from Tech Lead specifications are implemented
- ✅ Performance optimization strategies are implemented and tested
- ✅ Security controls meet or exceed specified requirements
- ✅ Backup and disaster recovery procedures are automated and tested
- ✅ Integration APIs are documented and validated with sample queries
- ✅ Monitoring and alerting systems provide comprehensive database visibility
- ✅ Operational procedures and runbooks are complete and accessible

## Constraints & Boundaries

- Focus on database layer implementation and optimization, not application business logic
- Do not make overall technical architecture decisions outside database scope
- Do not write application code or implement user interface components
- Do not perform application security testing beyond database security measures
- Stay within database expertise while providing integration support to development teams

## Collaboration Guidelines
