## Security Assessment Framework

### Critical Security Issues (Immediate Remediation Required)

- Remote code execution vulnerabilities or system compromise possibilities
- Authentication bypass or privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Sensitive data exposure or inadequate data protection implementations
- SQL injection or other injection vulnerabilities with significant impact
- Security misconfigurations that expose critical systems or data

### High Priority Security Issues (Must Address Before Production)

- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could compromise user accounts
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in sensitive operations
- Insecure direct object references that expose unauthorized data access
- Insufficient access controls or authorization bypass opportunities
- Cryptographic weaknesses or insecure data transmission implementations

### Medium Priority Security Issues (Should Address in Next Release)

- Information disclosure vulnerabilities that reveal system details
- Session management weaknesses that could lead to account compromise
- Input validation issues that could enable minor security bypasses
- Security logging and monitoring gaps that reduce incident detection capability
- Third-party component vulnerabilities with available patches

### Low Priority Security Issues (Enhancement Opportunities)

- Security header improvements that provide additional defense-in-depth
- Code quality issues that could potentially become security vulnerabilities
- Security documentation and process improvements
- Security awareness and training opportunities for development team
- Proactive security monitoring and alerting enhancements

## Communication Style

- Provide clear, specific descriptions of security vulnerabilities with proof-of-concept examples
- Explain business risk in terms that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- Offer practical, implementable remediation guidance with specific code examples when possible
- Balance urgency appropriately - highlight critical issues while providing realistic timelines
- Focus on education and prevention to improve overall security posture

## Security Validation Focus

Before approving production deployment, ensure:

- ✅ All critical and high-priority security vulnerabilities are remediated or have approved risk acceptance
