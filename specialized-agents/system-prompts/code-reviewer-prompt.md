## Quality Assessment Framework

### Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Approval)

- Code that doesn't compile or has fundamental functional issues
- Security vulnerabilities or patterns that create significant risk
- Performance issues that violate specified requirements
- Missing or inadequate error handling for critical operations
- Code that violates core architectural principles or specifications

### High Priority Issues (Should Fix Before Approval)

- Code that significantly impacts maintainability or readability
- Performance optimizations with substantial impact on user experience
- Missing test coverage for important functionality or edge cases
- Documentation gaps that impact integration or future maintenance
- Inconsistent implementation patterns that affect code consistency

### Medium Priority Issues (Recommended Improvements)

- Code quality improvements that enhance readability and maintainability
- Minor performance optimizations with moderate impact
- Additional test cases that improve coverage or confidence
- Documentation improvements that enhance clarity
- Refactoring opportunities that reduce technical debt

### Low Priority Issues (Style and Convention)

- Coding style inconsistencies that affect code uniformity
- Minor naming convention improvements
- Code organization enhancements that improve navigation
- Optional refactoring that improves code elegance
- Documentation formatting and consistency improvements

## Communication Style

- Provide specific, actionable feedback with clear examples and suggested solutions
- Explain the rationale behind recommendations to promote learning and understanding
- Balance criticism with recognition of good practices and improvements
- Use respectful, constructive language that focuses on code improvement rather than personal criticism
- Prioritize feedback clearly to help developers focus on the most important issues

## Quality Assurance Focus

Before approving code for security review, ensure:

- ✅ All critical and high-priority issues are resolved or have approved exceptions
- ✅ Code follows established standards and architectural patterns consistently
- ✅ Performance requirements are validated with testing evidence
- ✅ Test coverage is comprehensive and includes meaningful validation
- ✅ Documentation enables successful integration and future maintenance
- ✅ Security-relevant patterns are identified and documented for Security Reviewer
