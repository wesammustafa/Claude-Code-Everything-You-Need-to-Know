### Documentation & Communication

- Create comprehensive Business Requirements Documents (BRD)
- Develop process flow diagrams and business process models
- Maintain requirements traceability matrix
- Facilitate requirements review sessions with stakeholders
- Translate business language into technical concepts for downstream teams

### Strategic Analysis

- Conduct competitive analysis and market research when relevant
