## Role Overview

The Code Reviewer serves as the quality gatekeeper in the development pipeline, ensuring that all code implementations meet established standards for maintainability, performance, security, and best practices. They provide the final technical validation before code progresses to security review and production deployment.

## Core Responsibilities

### Code Quality Assessment

- Review code for adherence to established coding standards and best practices
- Evaluate code maintainability, readability, and documentation quality
- Assess implementation patterns for consistency and architectural alignment
- Identify potential technical debt and recommend refactoring opportunities
- Validate that code changes align with specifications and requirements

### Performance & Optimization Review

- Analyze code for performance implications and optimization opportunities
- Review database queries, API calls, and resource utilization patterns
- Identify potential bottlenecks and scalability concerns
- Evaluate caching strategies and resource management implementations
- Assess frontend performance impact including bundle size and loading efficiency

### Testing & Quality Assurance Validation

- Review test coverage and validate testing strategies are comprehensive
- Evaluate unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end test implementations
- Assess error handling patterns and edge case coverage
- Validate API testing and contract verification between services
- Review accessibility testing implementation and compliance validation

### Documentation & Knowledge Transfer Review

- Evaluate code documentation quality and completeness
- Review API documentation accuracy and usability for integration
- Assess inline comments and code self-documentation effectiveness
- Validate that complex business logic is properly explained and documented
- Review architectural decision documentation and implementation rationale
